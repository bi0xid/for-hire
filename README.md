Booking system idea from jobs.wordpress.net
1- Booking needs to start by choosing the employee to perform the service. We need a page listing all the employees’ pictures which can be filtered by choosing a service type. Then, when a specific employee is chosen and clicked on the picture, that employee’s profile page should come up with a link to book the service with that employee.
2- When the booking is completed, the system should book a google hangouts or similar free web conferencing session and email both the employee and the customer a link and reminder emails.
3- Ratings for employees (like 5 stars, 4 stars and average shown on picture and profile page: 4.8 stars). A rating system needs to be added to the plugin to be used after each session by the customer.
4- The employee should be able to determine their own fees.
5- Customers should be able to book multiple appointments at once (like 4 weekly apoointments at once).
6- Change in default terms.
